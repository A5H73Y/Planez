Planez has finally been updated from 2013, bringing with it improved code, plane ownership, fuel, economy, better permissions, and of course open-source.
Planez is now open source, allowing you to contribute ideas and enhancements, or create your own spin on the plugin.
Add a whole new level of role-play to any server that allows for planes or airports, perfect for city servers.
